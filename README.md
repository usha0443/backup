Automated Backup System
A. Project Overview
This project provides an automated backup script that creates compressed backups of important folders, verifies them, and manages old backups to save storage space. It ensures that your files are safely archived and that only the most relevant backups are kept.

What the Script Does
Takes a folder as input and creates a .tar.gz compressed backup file.
Generates a checksum to ensure that the backup is valid and not corrupted.
Skips unwanted folders like .git, node_modules, and temporary cache folders.
Automatically deletes older backups while keeping recent daily, weekly, and monthly backups.
Logs every action to a backup.log file.
Supports a dry-run mode to preview actions without making changes.
Why It Is Useful
Manually backing up files can be time‑consuming and easy to forget. This script automates the entire backup process, ensures data safety, and avoids wasted storage due to too many old backups.

B. How to Use It
1. Installation
Place the script file backup.sh and backup.conf in the same folder.
Make the script executable:
chmod +x backup.sh
(Optional) Edit backup.conf to customize:
BACKUP_DESTINATION=/home/backups
EXCLUDE_PATTERNS=".git,node_modules,.cache"
DAILY_KEEP=7
WEEKLY_KEEP=4
MONTHLY_KEEP=3
2. Basic Usage Examples
Purpose	Command Example
Run backup normally	./backup.sh /path/to/folder
Test without changing anything	./backup.sh --dry-run /path/to/folder
List existing backups	./backup.sh --list
Restore from a backup	./backup.sh --restore backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.tar.gz --to /path/to/restore/
3. Command Options
Option	Meaning
--dry-run	Shows what the script would do without making changes
--list	Displays all available backups
--restore <file> --to <path>	Extracts backup contents into a destination folder
C. How It Works
Backup Naming Format
backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.tar.gz
Example:

backup-2024-11-21-1904.tar.gz
Screenshot 2025-11-21 18:07:54
Excluding Unnecessary Files
The script reads patterns from EXCLUDE_PATTERNS and passes them to tar. Common skipped folders: .git, node_modules, .cache

Checksum Verification
After backup: A checksum (SHA256 by default) is generated.
The checksum is stored in a .md5 file.
During verification, the script recomputes and compares the two checksums.
Backup Rotation Rules
The script keeps:

The last 7 daily backups
The last 4 weekly backups (one backup per week)
The last 3 monthly backups (one backup per month)
Backups older than these are deleted.

Folder Structure
backups/
 ├── backup-2025-11-21-1904.tar.gz
 ├── backup-2025-11-21-1904.tar.gz.sha256
 └── ...
D. Design Decisions
Why This Approach?
Tar and gzip provide fast and widely supported compression.
SHA256 checksums are reliable for detecting corruption.
Rotation by date ensures predictable backup retention.
Challenges Faced
Challenge	Solution
Preventing two backup runs at the same time	Added a lock file /tmp/backup.lock
Avoiding unnecessary data in backups	User‑configurable exclude patterns
Saving storage space	Implemented daily/weekly/monthly rotation
E. Testing
Testing Steps
Ran the script in --dry-run mode to confirm actions.
Created real backups and verified checksum validation.
Deleted and restored sample test folders.

F. Known Limitations
Limitation	Explanation
Incremental backups not supported	Script currently backs up full folder every time
Email notifications simulated only	Real email sending requires configuring mail server
Date processing uses GNU date	On macOS, may require installing coreutils
Future Improvements
Add incremental backup support to save time and storage.
Add real email alerts for success/failure.
Add GUI or web interface for easier usage.
G. Conclusion

This automated backup system helps ensure your important files are safely archived and managed. It simplifies the entire backup process, from creating compressed backups to verifying them and cleaning up old files. While there are areas to improve, the script provides a strong foundation for reliable and efficient backups.
